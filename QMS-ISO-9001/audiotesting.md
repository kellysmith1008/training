Here's a quick look at our training topics. We'll start by defining the Quality Management System and explaining why we need it, then share the CivicActions Quality Policy and Objectives. We'll share a current update on the implementation status and how you can prepare for an audit. Lastly, we'll discuss what we expect from you and our next steps toward certification. 
Let's get started!

## The importance of ISO 9001 and QMS

Quality isn't just about being lucky, and ISO 9001 isn't just about certification. It's about growing with intent, planning, learning, and readjusting along the way. The phrase that captures the spirit of this effort is: "This is how we do good work, consistently." Quality establishes repeatable excellence, and the ISO 9001 helps us achieve this repeatable excellence. Let's talk more about what it is and what it means for us at CivicActions.

### ISO 9001 explained

So what exactly is ISO 9001? It's an industry standard, or framework, for ensuring consistent quality delivery. Part of this process is defining what quality means to us at CivicActions. It focuses on the outcomes we achieve, not just the processes we follow. It's flexible enough to align with our culture and how we love to work. 
What it's *not* is a prescriptive, rigid checklist nor extra work for the sake of extra work.
