Welcome to the Quality Management System training. In this module, we'll cover the ISO 9001 overview and what it means for us here at CivicActions. This training is key for the awareness of everyone across the company. This training provides the context for us to understand and embrace this initiative.

## Overview
<img width="568" height="312" alt="agenda topics are QMS, quality policy, objectives, updates on implementation, expectations and next steps" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591a382f-c7c4-4990-9f3a-6481f31de2c1" />

Here's a quick look at our training topics. We'll start by defining the Quality Management System and why we need it, and then we'll share the CivicActions Quality Policy and Objectives. We'll share a current update on the impplementation status and how you can prepare for an audit. Lastly, we'll talk about what we expect from you and what our next steps are toward certification. 

Let's get started!

## The importance of ISO 9001 and QMS 
                    {{Narrator |>}}
Quality isn't about getting lucky, and ISO 9001 isn't just about certification. It's about growing with intent, planning, learning, and readjusting along the way. The phrase that captures the spirit of this effort is: "This is how we do good work, consistently." Quality establishes repeatable excellence. The ISO 9001 helps us achieve this repeatable excellence. Let's talk more about what it is and what it means for us at CivicActions.

### ISO 9001 explained
<img width="567" height="317" alt="ISO 9001 certified" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698a9918-2d3d-4419-b473-85915bb3ff40" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
So what exactly is ISO 9001? It's an industry standard, or framework, for ensuring consistent quality delivery. Part of this process is getting to define what quality means to us at CivicActions. It focuses on the outcomes we achieve, not just the processes we follow. It's flexible enough to align with our culture and how we love to work. 
What it's *not* is a prescriptive, rigid checklist nor extra work for the sake of extra work.

### Quality Management System explained
<img width="561" height="318" alt="a stack of books that provide knowledge on a QMS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c36886-e640-4392-a661-ceab968e4c74" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
The Quality Management System, or QMS, is a collection of policies, procedures, feedback loops, and metrics. All of this information is housed in our CivicActions Confluence CMS space. It connects our existing key processes with a few new ones. Most importantly, it applies to everyone at CivicActions, not just our delivery team. 

### How's it work?
<img width="569" height="318" alt="4 stages of the QMS processes are plan, do, check, act" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8933a9a7-dae5-425e-83bc-acd9843e914d" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
The QMS operates on the Continual Improvement Cycle, often referred to as the PDCA: Plan, Do, Check, and Act. We **plan** by looking for opportunities to improve. We **do** by implementing those improvements. We **check** by measuring the results, and we **act** by standardizing the change and starting the cycle again. These processes help us monitor and continuously improve our service delivery to ensure consistent client results, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

### Why this matters
<img width="555" height="316" alt="A hiker makes it to the top of the quality mountain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a01777-13bd-4529-b57e-b86b88d8b084" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Implemented starting in 2026, this was part of our "Glow-up 2026" campaign; an effort to signal our maturity in professional services. By putting these intentional structures in place, we build our reputation, create scalable process that grow with us, and formalize our commitment to continual improvement.

## CivicActions Quality Policy
<img width="567" height="306" alt="CivicActions Quality Policy title slide" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0766157e-5b7f-41a9-b5c4-5e56861a0cf0" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Let's talk about our Quality Policy so we are all familiar with it. Remember, this quality policy applies to everyone at CivicActions, so it's important that we all know what it is and we understand it. 

### O<img width="560" height="264" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0ed5eda-ab8d-4090-b601-993decc7f225" />
ur quality policy

                    {{Narrator |>}}
"CivicActions **partners** with government agencies to make a **positive impact** by creating **human-centered services** that are **accessible to everyone**. CivicActions' commitment to quality means not only meeting customer expectations and complying with all necessary requirements, but also exceeding quality expectations through **company culture, continual improvement**, and **free and open technologies**. Let's break this down some more, and take the policy from promotion to practice.

### What the policy means in practice
<img width="555" height="257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff098cca-a6c0-4e6e-9408-e0223bb1556a" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
In practice, the policy drives our measurable goals, guides our key processes, and helps us identiy areas for growth. Most importantly, it builds a culture of quality that aligns with our core values and guides every decision we make.
