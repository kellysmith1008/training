Welcome to the Quality Management System training. In this module, we'll cover the ISO 9001 overview and what it means for us here at CivicActions. This training is key for the awareness of everyone across the company. This training provides the context for us to understand and embrace this initiative.

## Overview
<img width="568" height="312" alt="agenda topics are QMS, quality policy, objectives, updates on implementation, expectations, and next steps" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591a382f-c7c4-4990-9f3a-6481f31de2c1" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Here's a quick look at our training topics. We'll start by defining the Quality Management System and explaining why we need it, then share the CivicActions Quality Policy and Objectives. We'll share a current update on the implementation status and how you can prepare for an audit. Lastly, we'll discuss what we expect from you and our next steps toward certification. 
Let's get started!

## The importance of ISO 9001 and QMS 
                    {{Narrator |>}}
Quality isn't about getting lucky, and ISO 9001 isn't just about certification. It's about growing with intent, planning, learning, and readjusting along the way. The phrase that captures the spirit of this effort is: "This is how we do good work, consistently." Quality establishes repeatable excellence. The ISO 9001 helps us achieve this repeatable excellence. Let's talk more about what it is and what it means for us at CivicActions.

### ISO 9001 explained
<img width="567" height="317" alt="ISO 9001 certified" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698a9918-2d3d-4419-b473-85915bb3ff40" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
So what exactly is ISO 9001? It's an industry standard, or framework, for ensuring consistent quality delivery. Part of this process is defining what quality means to us at CivicActions. It focuses on the outcomes we achieve, not just the processes we follow. It's flexible enough to align with our culture and how we love to work. 
What it's *not* is a prescriptive, rigid checklist nor extra work for the sake of extra work.

### Quality Management System explained
<img width="561" height="318" alt="a stack of books that provide knowledge on a QMS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c36886-e640-4392-a661-ceab968e4c74" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
The Quality Management System, or QMS, is a collection of policies, procedures, feedback loops, and metrics. All of this information is housed in our CivicActions Confluence CMS space. It connects our existing key processes with a few new ones. Most importantly, it applies to everyone at CivicActions, not just our delivery team. 

### How does it work?
<img width="569" height="318" alt="4 stages of the QMS processes are plan, do, check, act" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8933a9a7-dae5-425e-83bc-acd9843e914d" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
The QMS operates on the Continual Improvement Cycle, often referred to as the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act). We **plan** by looking for opportunities to improve. We **do** by implementing those improvements. We **check** by measuring the results, and we **act** by standardizing the change and restarting the cycle. These processes help us monitor and continuously improve our service delivery to ensure consistent client results, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

### Why this matters
<img width="555" height="316" alt="A hiker makes it to the top of the quality mountain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a01777-13bd-4529-b57e-b86b88d8b084" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Implemented starting in 2026, this was part of our "Glow-up 2026" campaign; an effort to signal our maturity in professional services. By putting these intentional structures in place, we build our reputation, create scalable processes that grow with us, and formalize our commitment to continual improvement.

## CivicActions Quality Policy
<img width="558" height="309" alt="CivicActions quality policy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/555af56c-2a23-4704-955e-c272b20c296d" />
 
                    {{Narrator |>}}
"CivicActions **partners** with government agencies to make a **positive impact** by creating **human-centered services** that are **accessible to everyone**. CivicActions' commitment to quality means not only meeting customer expectations and complying with all necessary requirements, but also exceeding quality expectations through **company culture, continual improvement**, and **free and open technologies**. Let's break this down further and turn the policy from promotion to practice.

### What the policy means in practice
<img width="556" height="258" alt="a quality policy checklist" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59175da3-2a70-4cea-a4ee-d4db645b09e1" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
In practice, the policy drives our measurable goals, guides our key processes, and helps us identify areas for growth. Most importantly, it builds a culture of quality that aligns with our core values and guides every decision we make.

## CivicActions Quality Objectives
<img width="556" height="258" alt="A woman showing our 7 quality objectives on a clipboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2b5e01b-c058-42f4-9ada-f52d35122945" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Our quality objectives focus on seven key areas: Partnering, Positive Impact, Human-Centered Design, Accessible to Everyone, Company Culture, Free and Open Technologies, and Continual Improvement. We'll review our performance against these objectives each year. Let's take a deeper look at each of these objectives.

### Partnering
<img width="560" height="291" alt="We intentionally assess the alignment of all our partners." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/796aff50-97df-45b6-bc8f-d1191cc4b4e0" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Starting with partnering, our objective is to intentionally assess the alignment of all our partners. We want to work with those who share our values and quality expectations. This is done through our new Key Process, the Partner Criteria. This criterion will measure the assessment of new partners, completion of annual reviews, and tracking partner ratings.

### Positive impact
<img width="547" height="292" alt="We track impact across the project life cycle." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5288da39-aafa-4006-8dfc-e76db0e574e4" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
To achieve a positive impact, we track outcomes across the entire project life cycle to ensure our work meaningfully improves public outcomes. We apply Impact Criteria to new opportunities, tracking impact at key milestones, and including impact reflection in all retrospectives.

### Human-centered design
<img width="553" height="305" alt="We maintain human-centered experiences by using best practices and industry standards." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aefd28b-59c7-4719-b0f6-cf63a9be1422" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Our objective for human-centered design is to maintain best practices to build services centered on real user needs. This is supported by Competency and training. We measure this through HCD training completion rates and tracking HCD practices in our delivery work. 

### Accessible to everyone
<img width="556" height="296" alt="We seek to continually improve our accessibility practice, building on industry standards." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e064e8-66da-4e24-bd1f-3f93b3e21f30" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Similarly, we aim to continually improve our accessibility practice to build inclusive services by default. This is also supported by Competency and training. Our measures include accessibility training completion and continuous improvement against industry standards.

### Company culture
<img width="565" height="308" alt="Fostering a company culture defined by openness, balance, and care." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de8d59fd-7675-4910-b75b-0753bcc291a2" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Our strongest resource is our people power. Our company culture is defined by openness, balance, and care. Having a pulse on how we feel is important to delivering quality service. This is supported by our engagement survey. We'll measure participation, analyze trends, and track action items from your feedback. 

### Free and open technologies
<img width="560" height="315" alt="We deliver free and open source solutions for our clients." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9471d492-2630-42d1-a0c9-e335a5579392" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Our focus on free and open technologies is part of our secret sauce for delivering sustainable, open solutions. For our QMS, we'll monitor our contributions to the community and license tracking.

### Continual improvement
<img width="560" height="311" alt="We intentionally improve services based on feedback and experience." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a47685e2-5881-4415-b16d-f3f29236d719" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
Continual improvement is a core requirement of ISO 9001. Our intent is to learn and improve intentionally. In our service delivery, we'll continue to improve how we manage client requirements, handle our projects, address feedback, and ensure we capture feedback via project retros to feed the continual improvement cycle.

## What's next
<img width="558" height="308" alt="What to expect during the audit." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b783a38b-1e33-48f8-9c2a-47e089c07633" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
The audit is a review of our QMS documentation and procedures. The auditor will conduct an interview to understand how we work, assess consistency in our processes, and test our understanding of quality initiatives. This isn't meant to be a "gotcha" moment, nor is it about perfection or about making mistakes. The goal is to be honest and transparent.

### Your responsibilities
<img width="558" height="307" alt="What's expected of everyone." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b51d479-93f0-4bb7-ac94-f7fd0749c703" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
So how does all of this impact you? What are your responsibilities? Simply put, everyone at CivicActions needs to know our Quality Policy and our Quality Objectives, and where to find the QMS in Confluence. You need to understand your role in the process and actively contribute to continual improvement by participating in feedback and training. 

### Certification
<img width="565" height="307" alt="The roadmap to certification." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ea2dd45-a472-443b-88d8-c126d8ec4d83" />

                    {{Narrator |>}}
This is our roadmap to certification. We'll finalize objectives and metrics in Q1, followed by an internal audit. After addressing those findings, we'll engage the external auditor for the Stage 1 and Stage 2 audits, aiming to achieve ISO 9001 certification by Q2.
